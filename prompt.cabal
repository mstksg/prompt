name:                prompt
version:             0.1.1.2
synopsis:            Monad (and transformer) for deferred-effect pure
                     prompt-response queries
description:         Monad (and transformer) for delayed-effect "pure"
                     prompt-and-response queries.
                     .
                     Allows you to specify programs that might query a
                     database, talk to stdio, etc., without ever involving IO
                     or opening the door to arbitrary IO.  Write a potentially
                     pure computation describing prompting interactions, etc.,
                     without having your type actually do any IO or involve
                     itself with IO or any effectful context.
                     .
                     Useful as a source of "things from IO", without ever
                     actually involving IO or arbitrary IO itself; only
                     executing a specific subset of IO (or State, etc.) that
                     you yourself, the caller, specifies explicitly.  Safer
                     and more meaningful type.
                     .
                     For more information and instructions on usage with
                     examples, see <https://github.com/mstksg/prompt the README>.
